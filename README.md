Repository for Group Geo-Tracker project. Spring 2015. TCSS 450. Instructor: Menaka Abraham


BUILD PROJECT:
Within root of project you will find two "build" files. 

"win_build.bat" can be executed on a Windows box and will invoke the gradle build tool.

"unix_build.sh" can be executed on a Unix flavored box and will invoke the respective gradle build tool.

Both output apk's will be located in "app/build/outputs/apk/" and can be run on an Android Emulator. 

Alternatively, the folder can be loaded into Android Studio, run and emulated with the GUI build tools.
